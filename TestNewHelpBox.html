        If you have previously studied at higher education level you may be eligible for credit transfer. Credit transfer may help reduce the cost and
        the length of time involved in completing your undergraduate qualification and can be awarded for a wide range of completed qualifications or
        partially completed qualifications, or for study in a different subject area. You will only be considered for credit transfer if you <a href="#" id="creditTransferPopupAnchor" data-url="http://www8.open.ac.uk/study/credit-transfer/">apply now</a>.
        If you apply for credit transfer you must wait for the outcome of your application before proceeding any further with your registration on this qualification.

                        If you've registered for an Open University module before, you'll have been given a username and password.
                        Some online services, such as registration, are protected by password because they hold information personal to you,
                        or they're for OU students only.

                        If you've forgotten your username you can use your OU Personal Identifier (PI) instead.

            <h2>BA (Honours) History</h2>
            <p>With this degree course you will develop and deepen your knowledge of different periods of history from antiquity to the twentieth century.
                Engaging with a range of exciting and challenging topics such as imperialism, politics, social relations, medicine, warfare and religion in
                different periods, you will learn the skills of the historian in studying the materials of the past. You will also examine some of the critical
                approaches taken by historians to their subject matter.  We offer a number of alternative routes through the BA (Hons) History with different
                combinations of modules, allowing you to align your studies with your own particular historical interests. Studying within a broad framework
                designed to meet high national standards for single-subject history degrees, you will develop a range of skills in knowledge management, oral and
                written communication, critical reasoning, research, and information and communications technologies, all of which are highly valued in the modern
                workplace.</p>

            <h3>Career relevance and employability</h3>
            <p>Study of the arts and humanities requires an understanding of human activities in diverse cultural environments and in very different historical
                circumstances. The breadth of study and the range of cultural texts and objects analysed, combined with training in clear thinking and communication,
                make the BA (Hons) History relevant to a wide variety of careers, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>public administration, local government, the civil service, art institutions, and social services</li>
                <li>advertising, journalism, publishing, creative industries and public relations</li>
                <li>education</li>
                <li>legal work</li>
                <li>business, banking and retail</li>
                <li>human resources</li>
                <li>charities and campaigning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Employers greatly value the high-level skills acquired by studying a history degree – which may be broadly summarised as critical thinking, analysis,
                and communication. You’ll sharpen your IT, writing, and independent thinking skills, and develop the ability to assimilate and evaluate relevant
                information in constructing an argument. These are key skills in complex organisations, greatly sought after in the world beyond study – whether you’re
                already working, volunteering or changing career.</p>
            <p>There’s more information about how OU study can improve your employability in the OU’s Employability Statement from our Careers Advisory Service.
                You can also read or download our publication OU study and your career and look at our subject pages to find out about career opportunities.</p>
            <h3>Credit for previous study elsewhere</h3>
            <p>If you have already completed some successful study at higher education level at another institution you may be able to transfer credit for this
                study and count it towards this qualification. If you wish to apply to transfer credit you must do so as soon as possible, and before you register
                for this qualification. </p>
            <p>If you are awarded credit for study completed elsewhere, you may find that you need to study fewer OU modules to complete this qualification.
                This may also mean that the next start date and the maximum time limit for this qualification are different to those shown above.</p>
            <h3>Classification of your degree</h3>
            <p>On successful completion of the required modules you will be awarded a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) History degree.</p>
            <p>Your honours degree will be classified either as first-class honours, upper second-class honours, lower second-class honours or third-class honours. The class of degree is determined by your performance in a minimum of 120 and up to 240 credits from your best grades on specified OU (or specified collaborative scheme) history modules and interdisciplinary humanities modules at Level 2 or higher. At least 120 of those credits must come from modules at Level 3 and your best 120 credits at Level 3 will be given twice the weight of other modules used in the calculation of your classification.</p>
            <p>You will have the opportunity to attend a degree ceremony.</p>
            <h3>If you have a disability</h3>
            <p>Choosing the qualification that’s right for you is very important. Depending on your disability, long-term health condition, mental health disability or specific learning difficulty, you may need to consider any challenges posed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the learning objectives: for example, to gain an honours degree in a language you must be physically able to speak the language</li>
                <li>how the modules are taught: for example, some of our science qualifications require that you complete laboratory work</li>
                <li>any work-based competency requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Choosing the right qualification can be a complex mix of the subject requirements and the support you may need. To help you assess whether the qualification you are interested in will work for you, further advice is available from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>our Services for disabled students website</li>
                <li>your nearest regional or national centre.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Computing requirements</h3>
            <p>You will need a computer with internet access to study for this qualification. For most OU qualifications a Microsoft Windows (new since 2006), Apple Mac (OS X 10.5 or later) or Linux computer should be adequate. However, some qualifications require more specific IT equipment, in which case you will need additional software to use an Apple Mac or Linux computer. A detailed technical specification for your modules will be made available when you register. Please note, technical specifications do change over time to match computer developments and the way we teach.</p>
